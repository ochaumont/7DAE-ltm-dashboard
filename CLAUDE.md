# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Workspace layout

A single Next.js 15 / React 19 app at the repo root, plus a lightweight specification folder:

- Root — the **`ltm-dashboard`** application. Visual dashboard of Airbus **Lab Test Means** (LTM) backed by the live `atom-synchronizer-dev` API. Runs on port **3001**.
- `_specification/vibe coding/` — lightweight feature specs, one file per feature. This is where `/sweetforge.vibe` writes new specs.
- `deployment/nextjs-hello-chart/` — Helm chart for AFTER (Airbus Kubernetes platform). Service expects the container to listen on **8080** and exposes `/health` for liveness/readiness probes.

Implementation plans produced by Plan mode are written to `C:\Users\olivi\.claude\plans\` (outside this workspace), not under `_specification/`.

## Commands

Plain Next.js project, no test or lint script defined.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server on 3001
npm run build      # production build (output: "standalone")
npm start          # serve the build on 3001
```

When a refactor deletes routes or pages, `.next/` often holds stale chunks and dev/build will throw `Cannot find module './<hash>.js'`. Fix by removing `.next/` before rebuilding: `rm -rf .next`.

## Architecture

### Routes
- `/` → catalogue grid (`CatalogueClient`), paginated 6/page, URL-synced via `?page=`.
- `/map` → MapLibre full-screen view (`MapClient` + `MapView`), with a nested `app/map/layout.tsx` that scopes the `theme-map-first` class.
- `/labtestmean/[id]` → detail page with photo gallery, security/access, lifecycle timeline, people, programs/projects.
- `/health` → static JSON `{ "status": "ok" }`, used by the Helm chart's liveness/readiness probes.

There is **no** mock JSON, **no** `/bench/` segment, **no** `/d/<direction>` segment, and **no** panorama viewer. All three belonged to earlier iterations and have been deleted — do not reintroduce.

### Data flow
- Pages are server components (`export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`) that call `getLabTestMeans()` once and pass arrays to client components as props.
- `lib/atom-api.ts` — `fetch` against `${ATOM_API_BASE_URL}/api/infos/labtestmeans` (defaults to `http://localhost:8080/atom-synchronizer-dev`). Throws `AtomApiError` with `status: 0` on network failure; `app/error.tsx` matches the message to render a backend-down screen.
- `lib/labtestmean-adapter.ts` — maps the backend `LabTestMeanDto` → frontend `LabTestMean`. Derives `status` from lifecycle dates (`dismantled` → `out-of-service`, `mothballed` → `mothballed`, missing `eisdateyear` → `in-project`, else `operational`). Uppercases the `category` enum (formerly `testMeanType` upstream). Hardcodes country/city/geo lookup for the four known sites: **TLS, HMB, FIL, BRE** — anything else falls through to `Unknown` and is silently filtered out of `/map`.
- All cards/galleries currently use placeholder cover SVGs in `public/covers/` because the DTO has no photo fields. The detail-page gallery shows the same covers.
- Filtering happens client-side over the array passed from the server component.

### Two orthogonal theming axes
This is the single most important architectural idea and is easy to misread:

1. **Light ↔ Dark** — a user preference controlled by `[data-theme="light" | "dark"]` on `<html>`. All color tokens (`--color-bg`, `--color-fg`, `--color-accent`, `--color-success`, etc.) live in two blocks in `app/globals.css`. Structural tokens (`--font-*`, `--radius-*`) stay on bare `:root`. An inline anti-FOUC script in `<head>` (see `app/layout.tsx`) reads `localStorage.theme` or falls back to `prefers-color-scheme` before the first paint; the `ThemeToggle` (in the `Header` right slot) writes back via `lib/useTheme.ts`. Other consumers (notably `MapView` for tile-style selection) read the theme through the same `useTheme()` hook, which uses `useSyncExternalStore` + `MutationObserver` on `html[data-theme]`.

2. **Route theme class** — `theme-industrial-premium` applied on `<body>` in `app/layout.tsx`; `theme-map-first` applied inside `app/map/layout.tsx`. These classes only carry **structural** overrides (the glass panel, the card hover glow). They do **not** redefine color tokens — colors come exclusively from the `[data-theme]` axis. Translucent values use `color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-accent) X%, transparent)` so they adapt automatically.

When you change colors, the default is to edit `:root[data-theme="dark"]` / `:root[data-theme="light"]` in `app/globals.css`. Touch `styles/themes/*.css` only for structural overrides that cannot be expressed as tokens.

### Client/server boundary
- Page-level files in `app/` stay server components; state, effects, and browser APIs move into a dedicated `Client` component (`CatalogueClient`, `MapClient`, `Header`, `ThemeToggle`).
- `MapView` requires `window` (MapLibre) and is always imported via `dynamic(() => …, { ssr: false })` from `MapClient`. Keep it that way.
- The anti-FOUC script in `app/layout.tsx` is an exception — it ships as raw HTML via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` so it executes before hydration.

## Deployment

- `next.config.mjs` sets `output: "standalone"` so the build produces `.next/standalone/` (a self-contained Node server) and `.next/static/`.
- `Dockerfile` — multi-stage Node 20 image: builder runs `npm run build`, runtime copies `.next/standalone`, `.next/static`, and `public/` and runs `node server.js` on port 8080.
- `Jenkinsfile` stashes `.next/standalone`, `.next/static`, and `public/` between the build and Docker stages.
- The Helm chart (`deployment/nextjs-hello-chart/`) expects port **8080** and `/health`. The `/health` route is served by `app/health/route.ts`.

## Conventions to preserve

- **Routing is URL-clean**: `/`, `/map`, `/labtestmean/[id]`, `/health`. No query-string direction parameter, no `/d/` prefix, no `/bench/` segment. If a link needs another view, add a top-level route — don't reintroduce a direction axis.
- **Airbus logo**: single asset `public/airbus-logo.svg` using `fill="currentColor"`. It auto-inverts via `--color-fg`. Do not add a separate dark/light logo file unless a branded asset is explicitly required.
- **Header right slot**: reserved for future avatar / global search / notifications. `ThemeToggle` is the only current tenant. Keep the slot dimensioned to avoid reflow when new items are added.
- **Avatars**: never reach out to third-party avatar services (`pravatar.cc`, `gravatar`, etc.) — `components/Avatar.tsx` renders deterministic initials locally. The same component should be used for any new person/role surface.
- **Specs and plans are separate**: `/sweetforge.vibe` writes to `_specification/vibe coding/<slug>.md`; Plan mode writes to `C:\Users\olivi\.claude\plans\`. Never put planning artifacts under `_specification/`.

## Backend dependency

Spring Boot **`atom-synchronizer-dev`** served at `http://localhost:8080/atom-synchronizer-dev` with Springdoc OpenAPI at `/v3/api-docs`. Its `LabTestMean` entity (`GET /api/infos/labtestmeans`) is the single source of truth for the dashboard. The OpenAPI spec covers ~42 endpoints across sync processes, ATOM reads, KPIs, and connectivity healthchecks to LeanIX / Alfabet / ADAM / Google.

Override the base URL via `ATOM_API_BASE_URL` (read in `lib/atom-api.ts`).

## Slash commands

Custom workflows live in `.claude/commands/`. The two most-used in this repo:
- `/sweetforge.vibe <short idea>` — generate a lightweight feature spec under `_specification/vibe coding/`.
- SpecKit suite (`/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.implement`, etc.) — the heavier spec-kit flow.

Prefer the slash command over hand-writing spec files so the location and format stay consistent.

## Network calls — ask first

The user requires **explicit confirmation before every HTTP call**, GET included. This applies to `curl` / `wget` from Bash, `WebFetch`, MCP fetch-style tools, and any HTTP request to `atom-synchronizer-dev`, the internet, or any other service. Reading local files (Read/Glob/Grep) does not count. Writes (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) are always forbidden without explicit authorization.

Authorization is per-call: approval for one URL does not extend to related endpoints.
